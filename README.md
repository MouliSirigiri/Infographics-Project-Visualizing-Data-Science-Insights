# Infographics-Project-Visualizing-Data-Science-Insights

#**Overview**

This repository compiles key visualizations and infographics from multiple Applied Data Science assignments, transforming analytical reports into engaging, shareable graphics. Drawing from projects on energy consumption, cereal yields, time series forecasting, population clustering, and image captioning, the infographics highlight trends, models, and findings using charts, heatmaps, and plots. Created with tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Canva-style layouts, they emphasize storytelling through data—e.g., China's energy surge or LSTM forecast superiority—for policymakers, educators, and stakeholders.

**Key goals:**

Synthesize cross-project visuals into cohesive infographics.
Enhance readability with annotations, colors, and layouts.
Demonstrate impact: E.g., line plots for trends, bars for comparisons, clusters for patterns.

Insights: Energy/population links drive development (India's growth clusters); forecasts (e.g., Amazon to $250/share) aid decisions; visuals boost comprehension (e.g., 200% China energy rise in one glance).

#**Key Findings**

Cross-Theme: Energy/trends link to development (e.g., population drives consumption); visuals amplify (e.g., maps > tables for yields).
Visual Impact: Infographics reduce complexity—e.g., one page covers 5 projects vs. 50+ pages reports.

**Metrics Summary:**

Project,Key Visual,Insight Metric
Power Cons.,Line Plot,China +200% (2001-14)
Cereal Yield,Stacked Bar,US top (7k kg/ha)
Time Series,Forecast Line,LSTM MAPE=3.2%
Clustering,K-Means,"3 clusters, r=0.8"
Captioning,Sample Pairs,BLEU-4=0.28

#**Data Sources**

Energy: World Bank (EG.USE.ELEC.KH.PC).
Cereal: FAO (yield kg/hectare).
Time Series: Public (JJ: Box-Jenkins; Amazon: Yahoo).
Clustering: World Bank (1985–2019).
Captioning: MS COCO 2014.

#**Methods**

Tools: Matplotlib/Seaborn for plots; ReportLab for PDF assembly.
Design: Consistent palette (blues/greens for trends); annotations for insights.
Best Practices: Accessible (alt-text), scalable (vector PNGs).

#**Limitations and Future Work**

Static PDFs; future: Interactive (Plotly/Dash).
Subset data; expand to 2025+ for timeliness.
Add AR/VR infographics for immersion.
